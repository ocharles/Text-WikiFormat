    chromatic, C<chromatic@wgz.org>, with much input from the Jellybean team
    
    (including Jonathan Paulett).  Kate L Pugh has also provided several
    patches,
    
    many failing tests, and is usually the driving force behind new features and
    
    releases.  If you think this module is worth buying me a beer, she deserves
    at
    
    least half of it.
